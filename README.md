# Clustering Analysis on the Economist Democracy Index

## Project Overview
This project applies clustering algorithms to the Economist Democracy Index dataset to explore patterns among countries based on democratic indicators. The analysis provides hands-on experience with unsupervised learning techniques on a real-world socio-political dataset.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement clustering techniques and analyze how countries can be grouped based on similarities in their democratic characteristics.

## Dataset Description
The Economist Democracy Index is an annual index compiled by *The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)*. It evaluates the state of democracy across countries worldwide and is widely referenced in political and academic research.

The index is based on five key categories:
- **Electoral Process and Pluralism**
- **Functioning of Government**
- **Political Participation**
- **Political Culture**
- **Civil Liberties**

Countries are classified into four regime types based on their scores:
- Full democracies  
- Flawed democracies  
- Hybrid regimes  
- Authoritarian regimes  

## Methodology
The project follows these main steps:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applying K-means clustering
- Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Visualizing and interpreting clustering results

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Outcomes
- Identified meaningful clusters of countries based on democratic indicators
- Observed patterns and similarities across different political systems
- Demonstrated practical use of clustering algorithms on real-world data
